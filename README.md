# mpiFindIntegerMedian
Hoare's Select algorithm implemented in MPI for finding the median of an integer array

The program takes only one argument, the size of the integer array. Be sure not to exceed 2^31-1.

Validation of the median is built in within the program. It can run either in serial (by choosing number of processes = 1) or in parallel. Execution time is displayed in the end.

It serves as a good MPI Introductory example.
